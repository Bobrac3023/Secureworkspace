            <h2 class="startheader2">!!!EXPLORE THE MODERN WONDER OF THE WORLD!!! </h2>
            <p class="openpara"> A visit to the Taj is like going back in time. From the word go, the “mesmerizing effect” never leaves you. The Taj speaks volumes of the immense love and affection of a husband towards his wife.
                                A minimum of 3 hours is what I recommend you need to spend exploring the mausoleum. 
                             The intricately laid marble works transport you back in time. It makes one wonder how this impressive work of architecture was built with precision without the aid of modern tools and technologies.
                              A good camera should be your able companion as you capture moments for posterity .
                              Remember this mausoleum has been visited by kings, monarchs, presidents and the “who’s who” of the world.  
                              The security is extremely robust, so give yourselves ample lot of time to go through the large serpentine queues complete with frisking and physical pat downs. Remember, the Taj is in a high security zone.
                              The local populace is extremely friendly and welcoming, yet some may find it annoying. 
                              The nearby Agra Fort is a must see and so is a visit to the local markets to buy souvenirs.
